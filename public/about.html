<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Biotechnology Engineer and passionate Software Developer, driven by a strong interest in 
  building technology at the intersection of science and software.</p>

<p>I graduated as a Gold Medallist in Biotechnology Engineering from BMS College of Engineering, 
  completing my degree during 2019-2023. My academic journey helped me build a solid foundation 
  in biological sciences while developing a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset.</p>

<p>Currently, I work at Dassault Systèmes (BIOVIA), a leading product-based company, where I 
  contribute to the Pipeline Pilot Chemistry legacy product. I am the sole developer supporting 
  Pipeline Pilot Chemistry in India, collaborating with global teams to maintain, enhance, 
  and ensure the reliability of enterprise-grade chemistry workflows used across the industry.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional responsibilities, I enjoy exploring modern development tools, improving 
  system efficiency, and continuously expanding my skill set across both biotechnology and 
  software engineering. I'm particularly motivated by opportunities where science, data, and 
  scalable software come together to create real-world impact.</p>
